# üîÑ Torch - Version History

## **1.4.1** - Performance Optimization Update
- **Softmax optimization** ‚Üí Improved numerical stability by removing unsupported MakeCode Arcade features.
- **MAE function refactor** ‚Üí Reduced loop overhead for faster computation.
- **General activation function improvements** ‚Üí Optimized Sigmoid, Gelu, and other functions to avoid redundant calculations.

## **1.4.0** - Optimized Matrix Multiplication
- **Optimized `matmul()` in Torch.Tensor** to improve memory allocation and speed in MakeCode Arcade.

## **1.3.0** - Expanded Activation Functions
- Added new activation functions: **Hard Sigmoid, Bent Identity, and Mish**.
- Updated README to reflect the expanded activation function list.

## **1.2.0** - Added New Activation Functions
- Added **ELU**, **Swish**, and **GELU** activation functions.
- Updated README to reflect the full set of available activation functions.

## **1.1.2** - Improved Debugging
- Added error logging in `test.ts` to verify predictions.

## **1.1.1** - Tensor Operations Fix
- Improved **Tensor.add()** to match safety checks from `sub()`.

## **1.1.0** - Full ConvLayer Integration
- Added missing **forward()**, **backward()**, and **train()** methods to `ConvLayer`.
- Updated `Sequential` to properly handle convolutional layers.

## **1.0.0** - Initial Release
- Basic neural network structure with **Linear layers, Tensors, and Training support**.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Important Note  
- **`convert.py` was introduced via a direct GitHub commit** and exists **outside the standard versioning system**.  
- Users **are not required to be on version 1.4.0** to utilize PyTorch model conversion. However, for full compatibility with `convert.py`, a **Torch version greater than 1.1.0** is recommended.  
- To ensure access to the latest features, performance improvements, and full compatibility, **it is highly recommended to use the most recent version of Torch**.
