# Torch - Neural Network Library for MakeCode Arcade

Torch is a lightweight **neural network library** designed for use within **MakeCode Arcade**. It provides essential **tensor operations, basic neurons, and layer-based training** to build small-scale neural networks.

## 🚀 Features
- **Tensor Operations** → Supports matrix multiplication, element-wise function applications, and tensor addition.
- **Neuron & Linear Layers** → Implements simple neuron models and fully connected layers.
- **Convolutional Layer** → Enables basic convolution operations for feature extraction.
- **Training Support** → Uses **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss and backpropagation for weight updates.
- **Activation Functions** → Includes **ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Leaky ReLU, Softmax, ELU, Swish, GELU, Hard Sigmoid, Bent Identity, and Mish** for non-linear transformations.

### 🔹 GitHub Syncing Tip for MakeCode Arcade

Did you know? **MakeCode Arcade only pulls changes affecting managed project files**, but ignores externally added files like `history.md`.  
This means you can:
- Store **documentation or version history** externally without affecting the MakeCode project.
- Keep **development notes or testing scripts** only in GitHub.
- Maintain **extra resources** without cluttering the MakeCode editor.

If you need to **make non-code updates**, doing them externally can keep the project cleaner while still benefiting from GitHub's commit tracking!
