# Torch - Neural Network Library for MakeCode Arcade

Torch is a lightweight neural network library designed for use within MakeCode Arcade. It provides essential tensor operations, basic neurons, and layers for constructing and training small-scale neural networks.

## Features
- **Tensor Operations**: Matrix multiplication, element-wise function applications, and tensor addition.
- **Neuron & Linear Layers**: Simple neuron model and fully connected layers.
- **Convolutional Layer**: Basic convolutional operations for feature extraction.
- **Training Support**: Mean absolute error (MAE) loss and simple weight updates.
- **Activation Functions**: Includes ReLU for non-linear transformations.
